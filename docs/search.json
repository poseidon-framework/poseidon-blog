We welcome feedback to our posts, which you can give via Mastodon and our Slack Channel.\nPoseidon has been a project developed internally at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and is partially funded by the ERC-project MICROSCOPE.\nOur core mission is to make the growing field of archaeogenetics more [FAIR] and open, and to make data analysis of archaeogenetic data more widely and multidisciplinarily applicable. To this end, we intend to provide teaching material, make data available in standardised formats, and provide well-documented tools. Stay tuned for more development, and follow us on Mastodon and Slack."
