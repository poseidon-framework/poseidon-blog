    "section": "",
    "text": "In the ever-evolving world of ancient DNA research, staying up-to-date with the latest publications and datasets is essential. To address the challenges faced by researchers in this field, the Poseidon ecosystem has introduced a new feature - the Poseidon Archive Explorer. This dynamic web application offers a comprehensive overview of current Ancient DNA publications, providing a valuable resource for scholars and enthusiasts alike.\n\n\n\narchive explorer main UI\n\n\nIn the Poseidon ecosystem, there are three main components:\n\nThe Poseidon Package Format: This component serves as a standardized framework for organizing genotype data, along with associated meta- and contextual information. It offers a structured, yet adaptable, format that is easily readable by both humans and machines.\nThe Poseidon Software: This component encompasses a suite of in-house developed software tools and the Poseidon R package. These resources are designed to facilitate the efficient management of genotype data, ensuring ease and precision in data handling.\nPublic repositories : Poseidon currently maintains 3 Public repositories. The Poseidon Community Archive, The Poseidon Minotaur Archive, and The Poseidon AADR Archive. These repositories are carefully organized to store Ancient DNA genotyping data together with archaeological and laboratory context information. To learn more about each of their specific roles, you can visit this link\n\nThe Poseidon Ecosystem further underscores its commitment to data integrity by integrating an in-house web API with the GitHub Large File Storage system. This hybrid approach ensures robust version control and data cleanliness. Researchers and enthusiasts can benefit from this combination, fostering a harmonious ecosystem of data accessibility and precision.\n\n\n\nUI demo\n\n\nA Bridge Between Data and You\nThe concept behind the development of Archive Explorer is pretty straightforward. We’ve been housing all our Poseidon genotype data using the GIT Large File Storage system (GIT LFS). While that’s all fine and dandy for version control, we realized we needed something more interactive and user-friendly to share and visualize this data with the public. The solution? A dynamic web application built on JavaScript. When you land on the Archive Explorer page, you’ll notice it’s got some neat features. Up top, there’s an archive selector. This is your gateway to choose the specific archive you’re interested in. Then, we’ve thrown in a world map powered by the Leaflet map plugin because it’s open source and super easy to use.\nThis map? It’s not your regular map. It’s more like a bird’s-eye view of all the genotype data scattered across the globe. You can see data points from around the world, making it easy to grasp the big picture.\nThree Paths to Poseidon Genotype Data: Take Your Pick\nWe give you three different routes to get to the Poseidon genotype data you’re after:\n\nIf you know exactly what you’re looking for, you can type a full or partial name in our dynamic search bar and select the package you want.\nWant to explore data from a specific part of the world? Check out the world map, click on a marker, and voila! You’ll see a snapshot of what’s in that package, and a link to dive straight into it.\nFor those who prefer the manual approach, we’ve got a table view of all the publications available in each archive. You can roll up your sleeves and search for the info you need.\n\n\n\n\npackage view\n\n\n\n\n\npackage view\n\n\nGetting Up Close and Personal with the Data\nOnce you’ve picked a package, you can access it either through the map marker or by hitting that trusty magnifying glass icon on the table view. If you’re into details, the table view lets you view genotype data or download it as a “zip” file via our inhouse Poseidon server.\nExploring the Package: More Than Meets the Eye\nThe package view isn’t all that different from the general user interface, but it’s filtered to show only the markers that are relevant to that particular publication. And if you want to dig deeper, just click on each “PoseidonID” to access more detailed genotype information. We’re also cooking up a new feature to display some informative descriptive statistics for each publication, giving you a broader picture of the data. So stay tuned!\nIn a nutshell, the Archive Explorer is your one-stop shop for navigating the world of Poseidon genotype data. It’s got the goods for the pros and is user-friendly enough for the rest of us to dive into the fascinating realm of ancient DNA research."

    "title": "Trident’s restaurant - your order please?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image of a restaurant, by Unsplash\n\n\nToday we’re releasing a new major release for trident, our command-line tool and workhorse for working with Poseidon packages.\nIf you haven’t checked it out yet, take a look at our documentation. With trident, you can download packages from our web-server, initialise new packages, perform validations, list summaries of packages, and - most importantly - forge new packages out of existing ones. This functionality, forge is more than a merge, and more than a subset tool. It is both. Perhaps a working analogy for what it does is a restaurant. At a restaurant, you order a specific meal, but you don’t care how the ingredients have been packaged, and with which other ingredients they are stored. You just want the chefs to assmble the meal, no matter whether the beans are stored together with the peas or not.\nWith forge, you just show the program where to find the storage room (that’s what we call a base-directory that contains packages), and you tell it which individuals or groups you would like to include or exclude. Forge will then automatically look through all packages and assemble exactly the set of samples that you need in your new package.\nForge comes with a kind of mini-language to specify the ingredients that you need. This mini-language is something that we have clarified and subtly improved in this new release. There are four ways to ask forge to include entities in forge:\n\nInclude an individual by name: You can write &lt;EAS006&gt; (in angular brackets) to ask forge to look for the individual named “EAS006” (I’m glad you ask, it’s a male individual from Southern England who did 1500 years ago and was buried near a town called Eastry today.). If there are multiple versions of this individual, because there are multiple versions of packages, forge looks for this individual only on the latest version.\nInclude an individual by name, group and package: Sometimes, there are several individuals with that same name in your package collection, perhaps because you have multiple versions of the same package, or because for some reason you have already previously forged packages all in the same collection. In such a case, there is a more specific way to define an individual, via the syntax &lt;2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons-1.0.0:England_EMA:EAS006&gt;, which now specifies a very specific individual that is found in the given package and in the given group.\nInclude entire groups: You can write England_EMA to ask forge to look for all individuals that are associated with the group named “England_EMA” (I’m again glad you ask: EMA stands for “Early Middle Ages”). This again implicitly looks for the group only in the latest versions of packages.\nInclude entire packages: You can write *2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons* to ask forge to select for all individuals in the entire package.\n\nNote that you can combine these requests to merge them into the final forge. So for example you could say &lt;EAS006&gt;,&lt;EAS001&gt;,England_IronAge or so, which would then result in a package consisting of the two specified individuls plus all individuals from group “England_IronAge”. So this provides you with a lot of power already to select large numbers of samples in a succinct way. But sometimes you need even more power, because you want to also specifically exclude some samples. In forge, you can do that by prepending a minus-sign to any entity:\n\nExclude an individual by name: Write -&lt;EAS006&gt; to ask forge to remove any sample with that name from the final selection, in case it has been selected before.\nExclude an individual by name, group and package: Write -&lt;2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons-0.1.0:England_EMA:EAS006&gt; to not remove all individual with the name “EAS006”, but only the one in the specified package.\nExclude an entire group: Write -England_EMA to remove all individuals that belong to that group.\nExclude an entire package: Write -*2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons* to remove this package.\n\nSo now you can accurately describe what you want to include and exclude. Note that the order matters, as you would expect: *2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons*,-England_EMA,&lt;EAS006&gt; will contain a selection that includes &lt;EAS006&gt;, since it was added back at the end. In contrast, *2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons*,&lt;EAS006&gt;,-England_EMA will not include the sample, as the entire group was removed after it was added, so it got removed again.\nThere is one more gist: If your forge-list starts with an exclusion statement, so if you just write -*2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons*, then this implicitly means that you include all latest versions of packages in the base directory. So this is a way to forge everything except a given package or group or individual.\nThe exact semantics of this forge-machinery are quite complex and powerful, and we have clarified how this works in the latest version, and made it specifically more consistent and intuitive. This in particular concerns a feature that we now built in for the first time: You can now append versions of packages explicitly to a package-name, to select a specific version of a package. This works both in package requests, and in individuals by name, group and package.\nSo *2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons-1.2.1* works, and &lt;2022_Gretzinger_AngloSaxons-1.2.1:England_EMA:EAS006&gt; works as well.\nThere was quite a bunch of refactoring of code that needed to happen under the hood to make this update possible, in particular in relation to supporting multiple versions of packages. This update will bring us a good step closer to making archaeoenetics analyses truly reproducible, as older versions of packages will continue to be served on our servers (which we will post about separately)."

This years meeting, ISBA2023 was set to take place from 13th to 16th September in the city of Tartu in Estonia and entitled “New Horizons in Biomolecular Archaeology”. Naturally we decided to present Poseidon there to its core user group: practitioners in the field of archaeogenetics.\nWe applied with an ambitious abstract (the full text is available at the bottom of this post) and were awarded a poster. Below we share what we came up with. We tried to explain what motivates us to work on Poseidon and which components of the framework are already available. This includes the package format specification, the software tools, the public archives and the Minotaur workflow.\nThiseas C. Lamnidis and I finally presented the poster as the result of collaborative work with Ayshin Ghalichi, Dhananjaya B. A.

    "text": "Abstract\nPoseidon – Powerful and FAIR archaeogenetic genotype data management\nThe increase in ancient human DNA data requires robust yet flexible solutions to store and distribute it. While raw sequencing data is generally shared in large archives (e.g. ENA or SRA), no such standard exists for derived genotype data and contextual, spatiotemporal information. This raises concrete issues:\n\nAncient individuals only constitute meaningful observations if their spatiotemporal provenience is known. Current practice renders it difficult to maintain the connection between archaeological context and sampled genomic data.\nSpecific results can only be reproduced with genotypes. Current practice does not include their publication.\nMeta-analyses involving large amounts of data require tedious curation. Available public datasets have high key-person-risk, lag behind and are not well machine-readable.\n\nTo tackle these issues we present Poseidon, a computational framework including an open data format, software, and community-maintained archives to enable standardised and FAIR handling of archaeogenetic data. A Poseidon package bundles genotypes in industry-standard formats with human- and machine-readable context data, storing sample-wise information on spatiotemporal origin and genetic data quality. Through collective effort we already prepared 100+ packages for published studies in an open online repository.\nIn our talk we want to specifically highlight two components of the framework:\n\nA computational platform to process raw sequencing data directly from archive data (e.g. ENA), with a public interface for package curators to control processing parameters. Infrastructure will be provided by MPI-EVA, with community access and continuous integration provided via GitHub.\nCommand line software for package validation, manipulation and analysis. Validating structural integrity is a core task to honour the FAIR promise. The reliable structure then allows for advanced stream processing and co-analysis of genomic and contextual information."

    "text": "Image of cutlery, by Unsplash\n\n\nSo, you’ve ordered your food, now what?\nOften, we want to summarise the genetic data through summary statistics. Examples for such summary statistics are F-Statistics. Our tool xerxes fstats, which is part of the Poseidon ecosystem, provides a powerful and expressive tool to compute such summary statistics from genetic data described in Poseidon packages.\nSpecifically, you can for example reproduce the famous F4 statistics that first showed that Neandertalers, a group of close human relatives that disappeared around 45,000 years ago, interbred with modern human ancestors.\nThis is its form: F4(Chimpanzee, Neandertaler, African, European). It is defined in terms of average allele frequency correlation across a set of genetic positions.\nSo, which Chimpanzee, Neandertaler, African and European groups do we have in our datasets on our servers? Let’s find out:\n&gt; trident list --remote --groups | grep Chimp\ntrident v1.3.0.4 for poseidon v2.5.0, v2.6.0, v2.7.0, v2.7.1\nhttps://poseidon-framework.github.io\n\n[Info]    Downloading group data from server\n[Info]    Message from the Server: Greetings from the Poseidon Server, version 1.3.0.4\n| Chimp.REF                                                    | Reference_Genomes                       | 2.2.0           | 1              |\nCool, so there is a group called Chimp.REF in a package called “Reference Genomes” which looks right.

We’ll just go with Altai_Neanderthal.DG.\nFor the African and Europeans, you can do it similarly, but I’m just telling you that we want “Yoruba” (from Nigeria) and “French” (from, well, France).\nSo how do you get the data? Easy enough. You can just order your meal, remember? Here is the way to download the packages without even knowing which packages:\ntrident fetch -d ~/poseidon_repo -f 'Chimp.REF,Altai_Neanderthal.DG,Yoruba,French'\nThis will download the relevant packages into a repository location specified by -d. You can then just run:\nxerxes fstats -d ~/poseidon_repo --stat 'F4(Chimp.REF,Altai_Neanderthal.DG,Yoruba,French)'\nHere, -d gives the location of your package repository. This runs and outputs a bunch of stuff, and then closes with:\n.-----------.-----------.----------------------.--------.--------.---------.----------------.--------------------.------------------.-------------------.\n| Statistic |     a     |          b           |   c    |   d    | NrSites | Estimate_Total | Estimate_Jackknife | StdErr_Jackknife | Z_score_Jackknife |\n:===========:===========:======================:========:========:=========:================:====================:==================:===================:\n| F4        | Chimp.REF | Altai_Neanderthal.DG | Yoruba | French | 549812  | 1.5083e-3      | 1.5083e-3          | 1.9721e-4        | 7.648265856488313 |\n'-----------'-----------'----------------------'--------'--------'---------'----------------'--------------------'------------------'-------------------'\nThe very last number shows that this statistic is significantly positive (i.e. has a Z-score above 3), which shows that Altai_Neanderthal.DG is significantly more closely related to French than to Yoruba.\nOf course, xerxes fstats can do a lot more, and you can read about it in our documentation.\nWe have also added a detailed whitepaper now, which describes the mathematical details of the methods implemented here. For example, here is the table of listed statistics from the whitepaper:\n\n\n\nA table of F-Statistics\n\n\nF-Statistics are one important analysis tool used in the field, but there are of course a lot more, and we hope to implement some more in xerxes in the future."
