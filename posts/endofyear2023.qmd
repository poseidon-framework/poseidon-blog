It's late December and the time of the year when work slows down around here. For many of us an opportunity to take a break and to look back, contemplating the achievements of the year. I decided to do so as well and write a bit about Poseidon. What follows is a subjective account of the events in and around the framework in 2023 - each of my colleagues in the core team would probably emphasise different developments in such a write-up. That is in itself an achievement, because it shows how much the tech-stack, features and services in our little ecosystem have grown this year: beyond the understanding of each of us individually.

## The Poseidon schema

Let's start simple with the two new releases of the Poseidon schema we published this year: 2.7.0 and 2.7.1. They were published in short succession in March and May, the latter only slightly improving the .ssf files added in the first. See the changelog [here](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/changelog) for more details, but the addition of the [.ssf file](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/ssf_details) is indeed their most remarkable addition to the schema. With it we addressed a major desideratum and unresolved question in previous versions of Poseidon: How should genotype data be linked to the raw sequencing data on the ENA and other databases?

The .ssf file is, I would argue, a smart solution for this question. It specifies the very variables already used in the ENA database, allows for an extremely flexible, yet not arbitrary n:m connection between the entities in a Poseidon package and the raw data products and it can be generated semi-automatically for most of the data in our public archives. The .ssf file is then the very foundation on top of which the amazing Minotaur workflow is built (see below).

Generally, both the fact that only two Poseidon schema releases were necessary this year and that we could treat them as non-breaking changes indicate that we reached a certain level of maturity and stability here. We certainly have ideas how to extend it further in the future, but at the moment I'm optimistic that we can maintain long-term backwards compatibility. The process in which we discussed, specified and later improved the .ssf file definition to only then build Minotaur on top of it was a very satisfying professional experience.
