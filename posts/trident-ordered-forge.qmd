During 2024, a lot of features were added to our flagship software [trident](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/trident). One of them was the `--ordered` flag to `trident forge`.

As you may know, `trident forge` is one of our most advanced and powerful subcommands. A `forge` merges packages and subselects from them at the same time, forming a custom-collection of genomes (ancient or modern) pulled and merged from a large selection of packages. As I've introduced in a lot more detail [here](trident_14.qmd), you can easily select a number of groups or individuals, for example via

```
trident forge -d /path/to/poseidon_packages -f "French, Finnish, Spanish"
```

which will then go and select from the dozens or hundreds of packages those that contain these groups and output only those individuals from these three groups into a new custom-built Poseidon package. Now, in our original implementation, the order of samples would simply follow the order that the samples _originally_ appeared in their respective packages. So if you have a setup like this:

```
- Package1:
  - Francois (French)
  - Pedro (Spanish)
  - Vladimir (Russian)
  - Mika (Finnish)
- Package2:
  - Michele (French)
  - Sanni (Finnish)
```

the output will conist of 

```
- Francois (French)
- Pedro (Spanish)
- Mika (Finnish)
- Michele (French)
- Sanni (Finnish)
```

which means that your groups are mixed and not ordered. Often you don't care about the order, but sometimes you do. In particular, since `trident forge` not just outputs genotype data, but also gives you a custom new [Janno annotation file](https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/janno_details), which is a table of all meta-information for your samples. Having this ordered can be helpful.

So in [Release 1.5.4.0](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-hs/releases/tag/v1.5.4.0), we introduced a new flag `--ordered` to `trident forge`, which outputs samples not in the order of their original packages, but in the order that you, well, ordered them, if I may go back to my [restaurant analogy from an earlier blog post](trident_14.qmd).

So with `--ordered` the output of the above toy example which asked for `French`, `Finnish` and `Spanish` (in that order) will be:

```
- Francois (French)
- Michele (French)
- Mika (Finnish)
- Sanni (Finnish)
- Pedro (Spanish)
```

So I think this will be a very useful feature for creating custom collections.
