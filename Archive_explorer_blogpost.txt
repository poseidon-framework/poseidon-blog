                                         Navigating the Ancient DNA Landscape: Introducing the Poseidon Archive Explorer

In the ever-evolving world of ancient DNA research, staying up-to-date with the latest publications and datasets is essential. To address the challenges faced by researchers in this field, the Poseidon ecosystem has introduced a new feature - the Poseidon Archive Explorer. This dynamic web application offers a comprehensive overview of current Ancient DNA publications, providing a valuable resource for scholars and enthusiasts alike.

In the Poseidon ecosystem, there are three main components: The Poseidon Community Archive, The Poseidon Minotaur Archive, and The Poseidon AADR Archive. These repositories are carefully organized to store valuable ancient DNA data. To learn more about each of their specific roles, you can visit this link [https://www.poseidon-adna.org/#/archive_overview].The Poseidon Ecosystem further underscores its commitment to data integrity by integrating an in-house web API with the GitHub Large File Storage system. This hybrid approach ensures robust version control and data cleanliness. Researchers and enthusiasts can benefit from this combination, fostering a harmonious ecosystem of data accessibility and precision.

The Poseidon Archive Explorer: Bridging the Gap

The Poseidon Archive Explorer was developed with the aim of addressing the technical challenges often encountered by users when navigating the Poseidon ecosystem. This innovative web application provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the exploration of the extensive ancient DNA data. Here are some of its prominent features:

                                        *)Dual Archive Support: The Poseidon Archive Explorer seamlessly supports both The Poseidon Community Archive and The Poseidon AADR Archive. This integration provides users with access to a diverse range of ancient DNA publications.

                                        *)Real-Time Visualization: A key highlight of the Archive Explorer is its ability to real-time visualize the current available samples on a world map. This interactive feature allows users to geographically locate and explore datasets with ease.

                                        *)Effortless Data Downloads: Researchers often require access to genotype data for their studies. The Archive Explorer simplifies this process with a "One-click download" button, streamlining the retrieval of essential genotype information.

The Archive Explorer: A Bridge Between Data and You

The concept behind the development of Archive Explorer is pretty straightforward. We've been housing all our Poseidon genotype data using the GIT Large File Storage system (GIT LFS). While that's all fine and dandy for version control, we realized we needed something more interactive and user-friendly to share and visualize this data with the public. The solution? A dynamic web application built on JavaScript.

Navigating the Archive Explorer:

When you land on the Archive Explorer page, you'll notice it's got some neat features. Up top, there's an archive selector. This is your gateway to choose the specific archive you're interested in. Then, we've thrown in a world map powered by the Leaflet map plugin because it's open source and super easy to use.

This map? It's not your regular map. It's more like a bird's-eye view of all the genotype data scattered across the globe. You can see data points from around the world, making it easy to grasp the big picture.

Three Paths to Poseidon Genotype Data: Take Your Pick

We give you three different routes to get to the Poseidon genotype data you're after:

1) If you know exactly what you're looking for, you can type a full or partial name in our dynamic search bar and select the package you want.

2) Want to explore data from a specific part of the world? Check out the world map, click on a marker, and voila! You'll see a snapshot of what's in that package, and a link to dive straight into it.

3) For those who prefer the manual approach, we've got a table view of all the publications available in each archive. You can roll up your sleeves and search for the info you need.

Getting Up Close and Personal with the Data

Once you've picked a package, you can access it either through the map marker or by hitting that trusty magnifying glass icon on the table view. If you're into details, the table view lets you view genotype data in GIT LFS or download it as a "zip" file.

Exploring the Package: More Than Meets the Eye

The package view isn't all that different from the general user interface, but it's filtered to show only the markers that are relevant to that particular publication. And if you want to dig deeper, just click on each Poseidon_ID to access more detailed genotype information. We're also cooking up a new feature to display some informative descriptive statistics for each publication, giving you a broader picture of the data. So stay tuned!

In a nutshell, the Archive Explorer is your one-stop shop for navigating the world of Poseidon genotype data. It's got the goods for the pros and is user-friendly enough for the rest of us to dive into the fascinating realm of ancient DNA research.
